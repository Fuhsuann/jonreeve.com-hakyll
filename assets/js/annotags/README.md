#About Annotags

Have you ever wanted to livetweet a book? Annotags creates hashtags that make that possible. Annotags is a decentralized textual annotation protocol. It's a way to encode bibliographic information into a short code that can be used in a hashtag on microblogging sites. For more, see the [introductory blog post](http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags/about.html), or try out the [web app calculator](http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags/about.html).   

#About this Repository

This repository currently contains javascript assets that are used to control the [Annotag Calculator](http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags/) and [Annotag Bookmarklet](http://jonreeve.com/2015/04/a-bookmarklet-for-creating-annotags/) on my website, [jonreeve.com](http://jonreeve.com). Eventually, the calculator and bookmarklet will move to their own domain, and this repository will contain the whole site for that domain, but for now, this is just used as a submodule in the [JonathanReeve.github.io](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/JonathanReeve.github.io) repository. This submodule just makes it easier to organize everything related to Annotags. 

#Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests with whatever you like. I'd recommend testing it first by running Jekyll on a local copy of JonathanReeve.github.io. Also, feel free to help me try to implement Annotags as its own website! You can use this repository as a submodule that can live in your website's `assets/js`.
